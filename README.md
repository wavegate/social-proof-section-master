## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned that setting the height of the body to 100% sets its height to HTML, which takes its height from the viewport.
- I practiced using multiple backgrounds on a single element, and using pseudoelements to place images.

### Continued development

- I'm not sure if Flexbox is the best way to do all these layouts but it seems to work fine for me for now. I'm starting to get a lot of divs in my HTML, so I'm concerned things will start to get out of hand once I add more and more complicated layouts.
- I wasn't able to figure out how to space out the stars while drawing them out with pseudoelements.
- I had some trouble getting the background images to work properly, and was getting quite confused setting the height of the body from viewheight to auto and back and forth. I wasn't sure how the background positioning was working.
